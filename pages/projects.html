                    An app that compares Counter Strike weapon skin prices from marketplaces "Buff.163" and "Skinport". 
                </p>
                <p>Background info: <br>
                    Buff usually has cheaper prices, then most markets. So having Buff balance is important.
                    But depositing money on Buff is difficult since you need a Chinese residency.
                    So with this tool, you can find cheaper skins on Skinport and then sell them on Buff, for a slight profit along with balance.
